# Evaluate-the-performance-of-two-machine-learning-models
develop and evaluate the performance of two machine learning models, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), for spam classification. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), for spam classification. The dataset consists of 4,601 email samples, where 58 numerical features represent different characteristics of emails. The k-NN classifier uses a k-value of 3 and Euclidean distance, while the MLP classifier has two hidden layers with 10 and 5 neurons respectively, and uses a logistic function as the activation function. We train the model using a pre-split training set and evaluate its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using the test set. The purpose of this project is to contribute to spam detection systems and improve email security.
